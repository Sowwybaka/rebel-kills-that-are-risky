    <h1> About rick rolling </h1>
    <p>Rickrolling, alternatively Rick-rolling or Rickroll, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up," performed by the English singer Rick Astley. The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places.</p>
    <h1> How it is used </h1>
    <p>Rickrolling is the art of tricking a person into opening a video of Rick Astley singing his hit song "Never Gonna Give You Up". Normally users posting such links will pretend that they are relevant to the topic in order to fool people into the opening. If you've ever been rickrolled, you'll know how torturous it is. However, not all rickrolls are links, people have found clever ways to rick roll people like presentations, disguised links and sharing your screen in Zoom. Next time there's a very annoying person in a chat room, make sure to rickroll that person.</p>
